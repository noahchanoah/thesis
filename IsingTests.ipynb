    "The Ising model Hamiltonian is $\\mathcal{H} = -J\\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j - \\sum_j h\\sigma_j$. The partition function is $Z=\\sum_{\\{\\sigma_i\\}} e^{-\\beta U}$ with $U=-\\epsilon\\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j$ (8.38 and 8.39). The partition function sums over each possible lattice states but there are $2^N$ possible lattice states so for a $10\\times 10$ lattice, we have $2^{10^2}\\approx 10^{30}$ configurations. This means writing a program that attempts to analyze each possible lattice state will not succeed.\n",

    "The Metropolis algorithim is a method of importance sampling that generates sample satets for a Monte Carlo simulation (integration) with the correct Boltzmann probabilities. This is a natural choice because we should *probably* sample the most likely states the most --- we don't need to sample extremely rare states. (Think of choosing a more clever volume to integrate over instead of a rectangle to approximate the volume of some other shape). **Schroeder uses periodic (torus) BC**."
